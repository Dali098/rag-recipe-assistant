## How to Cook Pasta Al Dente

1. Use a large pot and plenty of water (around 1 liter per 100 g of pasta).
2. Bring the water to a strong boil and add salt (about 1 tablespoon per 2–3 liters of water).
3. Add the pasta and stir once or twice so it doesn’t stick together.
4. Cook 1–2 minutes less than the package instructions — taste it to check.
5. Pasta should feel slightly firm inside (*al dente*).
6. Drain, but keep a few tablespoons of starchy pasta water if you want to mix it with sauce.
7. Avoid rinsing pasta if you plan to mix it with sauce — starch helps the sauce stick better.

## How to Pan-Fry Chicken Properly

1. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels — moisture prevents browning.
2. Season with salt, pepper, and spices of your choice.
3. Heat oil in a pan over medium or medium-high heat.
4. Add chicken in a single layer — do not overcrowd the pan.
5. Cook 4–7 minutes per side depending on thickness, until golden brown.
6. The inside should be fully cooked — no pink juices.  
   If needed, lower the heat and cook covered for a couple more minutes.
7. Let the chicken rest for 2–3 minutes before cutting for juicier results.

## General Tips for Roasting Vegetables

1. Cut vegetables into similar-sized pieces for even cooking.
2. Mix vegetables with oil and salt in a bowl instead of on the tray — coats them better.
3. Spread in a single layer — crowded trays steam instead of roast.
4. Bake at 180–200 °C for most vegetables.
5. Stir or flip once halfway for more even browning.
6. A little caramelization (browning) means more flavor.

## Simple Seasoning Logic

1. Basic spice combos that rarely fail:
   - **Chicken:** salt, pepper, paprika, garlic, thyme
   - **Vegetables:** salt, pepper, oregano, rosemary
2. Start with small amounts — 1/2 teaspoon of spice per 500 g of product.
3. Taste as you go and adjust gradually.
4. Lemon juice or vinegar can brighten flavors; olive oil makes seasoning stick better.

## General Beginner Kitchen Tips

1. Taste food while cooking — seasoning is easier to fix early.
2. Preheat the oven/pan before adding food for better texture.
3. Use a timer if you tend to forget — simple but life-saving.
4. Wash and chop everything before cooking (mise en place makes cooking faster).
5. Keep your knife sharp — a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one.

## How to Improve and Thicken a Simple Sauce

1. Simmer sauce uncovered — moisture evaporates, and it naturally thickens.
2. Add 1–2 tbsp of pasta water when mixing with pasta — starch helps sauce cling better.
3. A small knob of butter at the end adds gloss and smoother texture.
4. Taste and adjust salt, pepper, or sugar if the tomato sauce is too acidic.

## How to Get Crispy Potatoes in the Oven

1. Cut potatoes into similar-sized pieces for even cooking.
2. Pat dry before seasoning — moisture prevents browning.
3. Use enough oil to lightly coat all surfaces.
4. Spread potatoes in a single layer, do **not** pile.
5. Higher temperature (200–220 °C) = crispier edges.
6. Flip halfway through baking for best results.

## How to Make a Fluffy Omelette

1. Beat eggs thoroughly — more air means softer texture.
2. Adding 1–3 tbsp of milk or water makes the omelette lighter.
3. Cook over **medium-low heat**, not high — prevents rubbery texture.
4. Cover with a lid for 1–2 minutes to help top set without burning the bottom.
5. Add cheese or filling when eggs are 70% set, then fold.

## Tips for Baking Chicken in the Oven

1. Marinate chicken 15–30 minutes (oil + salt + spices) for better flavor.
2. Keep pieces similar in size so they cook evenly.
3. Do not overbake — chicken breast can dry out fast.
4. Check internal doneness: clear juices = ready.
5. Rest 5 minutes after baking so juices redistribute.

## Making Simple Salads Taste Better

1. Sprinkle a little salt directly on cut tomatoes — brings out flavor.
2. Add acid + fat: **olive oil + lemon juice** is classic and always works.
3. Herbs transform a dish — parsley, dill, basil = instant upgrade.
4. Chill vegetables beforehand for crunchier texture.
5. Mix dressing separately first for even coating.

## How to Cook Rice That Is Not Mushy

1. Rinse rice 2–3 times to remove excess starch.
2. Use a 1:2 rice-to-water ratio for most white rice.
3. Do not open the lid during cooking — steam must stay inside.
4. Let rest off heat 5–10 minutes before serving.
5. Fluff gently with a fork (not a spoon) to keep grains separate.
